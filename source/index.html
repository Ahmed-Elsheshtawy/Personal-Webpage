                    The problem we solved? Well, <strong>95% of failed lab tests (like blood tests) fail in the pre-analytical phase. Meaning these tests
                     fail before the sample enters the lab. Alright, what is the problem here? Well, the cost of these errors and failures is
                      estimated to be around $450,000 per hospital.</strong> And the main reason behind this problem is Miscommunication and language barrier between the patient and the doctor.
                    <strong>And our solution? We developed Dalil, your guide for lab test preparation. Dalil provides clear instructions for the patient
                     on what they should do before their lab test.</strong> Whether they shouldn't eat some meal, whether they shouldn't drink something,
                      or whether they shouldn't do some exercise as an example. Well, what is different about dalil? Dalil is going to provide
                       educational visual graphics and multilingual instructions, ensuring that any patient can understand the instructions,
                        and ensuring we cut down lab test costs and save hospitals thousands.
                    Although I had high expectations that me and great team would advance to the next stage, we unfortunately didn't.
                     Nevertheless, this was an amazing opportunity for me to improve my skills.
                    The full source code for the mobile application is available on my Github Page.

                    Won 1st place with my team Binary Brigades at the AIX Hackathon 2025 organized by risin ventures at QSTP. <br/>
                    The problem statement was simple, "QDB has a lot of investment opportunities to inspect. QDB has to hire employees with expertise on evaluating investment opportunities. QDB has to wait until investment experts finish their reports on the investments. How can we reduce the cost/money & time spent?". Our Solution? <strong>We developed an AI copilot (using Gemini's 2.5 pro model) that assists QDB in investment opportunities, saving time, effort and money. The analysis produced by the AI model includes useful data, such as Key Weaknesses, Key Strengths, Market Position, Top competitors in the specified market, and much more.</strong>

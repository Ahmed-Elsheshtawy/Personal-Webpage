                        What is Ni'mah? Ni'mah is an idea, an idea that me and my team plan to improve and turn into a successful startup.
                        In this blog post, I'll share my journey with Ni'mah so far, including the challenges we've faced, the milestones we've achieved, and our vision for the future.

                    <p>
                        Ni'mah aims to address the issue of food waste and hunger by connecting surplus food from restaurants and open buffets with people in need.
                        Our platform facilitates the efficient redistribution of food, ensuring that excess food reaches those who can benefit from it, rather than going to waste.

                    <h2>How does Ni'mah Solve this?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Ni'mah operates through a user-friendly mobile application that allows restaurants to list their surplus food and individuals in need to claim it.
                        Here are the key steps involved in our process:
                    </p>
                    <h3></h3>
                    <ol class="content-list">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Food Listing:</strong> Restaurants and buffet providers can easily list their surplus food items on the Ni'mah app, specifying details such as quantity, type of food, and pickup time.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Food Claiming:</strong> Individuals in need can browse available food listings on the app and claim items that suit their preferences and dietary requirements.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Pickup Coordination:</strong> Once a food item is claimed, the app facilitates communication between the restaurant and the claimant to arrange a convenient pickup time and location.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Feedback and Ratings:</strong> After the food has been picked up, both parties can provide feedback and ratings to ensure quality and reliability within the Ni'mah community.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
